# [Lightweight ngBoilerplate](http://joshdmiller.github.com/ng-boilerplate) [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/ngbp/ngbp.png?branch=v0.3.2-release)](https://travis-ci.org/ngbp/ngbp)

NgBoilerplate is an opinionated kickstarter for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) projects. This fork removes files and code that will not be relevant anymore, once you start building a commercial application on top of ngBoilerplate.

So once you have read the documentation on the original fork and got yourself familiar with the code there, you can clone this fork as soon as you're ready to hack your own project.

***

## Quick Start

Install Node.js and then:

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/gauravsaraf/ngbp your-project
$ cd your-project
$ sudo npm -g install grunt-cli karma bower
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt watch
```

Finally, open `file:///path/to/your-project/build/index.html` in your browser.

Happy hacking!
